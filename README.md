### About

This Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browser Extension for the subreddits [r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime) and [r/manga](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga) enhances the experience of the subreddit. It enables easy search and use for commentfaces, easy search and insertion of library entries via AniList (anime, manga, staff members, characters, studios) and a comfortable Spoiler-Tag-button.

Newly taken over by the r/anime mod team and u/baseballlover723 specifically.
